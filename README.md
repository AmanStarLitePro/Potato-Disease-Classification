# Potato Disease Classification
 Detect Early Blight Leaf, Healthy Leaf, Late Blight Leaf 

Welcome to the **Potato Disease Classification** repository! , this project leverages cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning technologies to enhance Potato Leaf Disease Classification.

## üìÑ Introduction
This code sets up a FastAPI server that utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify images uploaded via API into different classes of potato diseases.
The primary objectives is:
- Detect the Disease in Potato Leaf.

The system integrates CNN Architecture to detect disease in leaf.

## üéØ Features

### üñº Object Detection
**Ping Endpoint**
- Responds with "Server is Ready" to indicate the server status.

**Prediction Endpoint**
- Accepts an image file via POST request, processes it using a pre-trained TensorFlow model (my_model.keras), and returns the predicted class and confidence score of the image.

**Output**
- The model outputs predicted class and confidence of prediction.

## Server Access Using Postman Software

- API accessible via the local host server at `http://localhost:8000`.

- Install Postman:

- If you haven't already, download and install Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
- Create a New Request:

- Open Postman and click on New to create a new HTTP request.
- Set the Request Type and URL:

- Select POST as the request type.
- Enter the API endpoint URL: http://localhost:8000/predict.

- Set Headers:
- Add a new header with key 'Content-Type' and value 'multipart/form-data'. 

- Set the Body:
- Click on the Body tab and Select the "form-data" option.
- Add a new key-value pair where the key is file (must match the parameter name file in your FastAPI endpoint) and the value is the image file you want to classify. You can either drag 
  and drop the image file or select it using the file picker.

- Send the Request:
- Click on Send to submit your request to the API.

- You should receive a response with the predicted class and confidence of prediction.

For more details on using Postman, refer to the [Postman Documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/).
